#+TITLE: Bookmarks

This is more of an interesting (subjectively) links feed than a list of bookmarks.

Use the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkeep/bookmarks/master/feed.xml][RSS feed]] to subscribe to this list.

How it works:
- Every time I find something interesting, I use [[https://newsboat.org/releases/2.26/docs/newsboat.html#_bookmarking][newsboat's bookmark feature]] to append it here.
- Every day, at noon, a [[cron.sh][cron job]] commits and pushes any changes.
